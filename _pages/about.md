Owen Taylor | Mechanical Engineering Student

Hello! I'm Owen Taylor, a second-year Mechanical Engineering student at Toronto Metropolitan University, with a keen focus on automotive engineering and sustainable technologies. This portfolio is designed to showcase my academic achievements, hands-on projects, and technical skills, all of which reflect my readiness to contribute to a dynamic engineering team through co-op placements or internships.

Engineering Excellence and Practical Experience
------
Despite being in the early stages of my academic journey, I have demonstrated a strong command of engineering fundamentals and an ability to apply them to real-world challenges. My coursework has provided me with a solid foundation in areas such as fluid mechanics, materials science, and thermodynamics, and I have consistently ranked among the top students in my class.

Beyond the classroom, I have gained valuable practical experience as a key member of the Toronto Met Formula Racing Team. My role has involved designing and implementing low-voltage power control circuits, critical for ensuring the reliability and performance of our race car's electrical systems. I have also led the development of a regenerative braking system, optimizing energy recovery to improve overall vehicle efficiency—a project that underscores my ability to innovate and deliver results under pressure. 

Innovative Projects and Technical Skills
------
My portfolio highlights a range of projects that demonstrate my technical expertise and problem-solving abilities. From creating a custom DC/DC converter to integrating advanced algorithms for energy management, my work reflects a deep understanding of both theoretical principles and practical applications. I am proficient in industry-standard tools such as SolidWorks, MATLAB, and AutoCAD, and I have hands-on experience with prototyping and testing in a fast-paced, team-oriented environment.

Career Aspirations
